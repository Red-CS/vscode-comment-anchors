## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Comment-anchors](https://github.com/ExodiusStudios/vscode-comment-anchors/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, make sure to commit what you have patched/added. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit). 

Always write a clear log message for your commits. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines while writing your commits. The following commit types are in use in this repository:

- `feat`: for new features and improvements
- `fix`: for bugfixes and minor rewrites
- `change`: for larger rewrites or improvements to existing code
- `chore`: for updates to project meta files

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ExodiusStudios/vscode-comment-anchors/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ExodiusStudios/vscode-comment-anchors/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Optionally, suggest your change in [our community Discord](https://discord.gg/exaQDX2), in the #anchor-chat channel, and start writing code in a local fork.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the Comment Anchors source in our discord, preferably in the channel #comment-anchors.

* Open an issue ticket, clearly specifying your question, however it is still recommended to ask on our discord first.

Comment-Anchors is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join!
